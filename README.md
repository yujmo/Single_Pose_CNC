# Single_Pose_CNC
This is the implementation of **fast estimating pedestrian moving state based on single 2d body pose by shallow neural network**

## Note
1. This repository include the model training and data loading code and trained model weights.
2. AMO is well explained in the letter and very easy to implement, we don't release code here and encourage discussion of new AMO alogrithm.
3. More details will be released after the decision of acceptence.

## File
main.py is the training code of C/NC/LONG classifier.
data.py prepares data for main.py. (Edit the directory before you run it)
net.pkl is a set of weights we trained.
